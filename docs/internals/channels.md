# Channels & Message Bus

## 1. Purpose

The channels subsystem is durin's input/output layer. It translates
platform-specific events (Telegram messages, Discord DMs, WebSocket frames,
emails, Slack events, and others) into a neutral `InboundMessage` that the
agent loop can process, and routes `OutboundMessage` responses back to the
originating platform without the agent ever knowing which platform it is
talking to.

Three concerns are handled here that belong nowhere else:

- **Plugin discovery** — new channel adapters can be added as Python packages
  and are loaded automatically at startup.
- **Permission and pairing** — inbound authorization is enforced once,
  centrally, at the message-bus ingress gate; unapproved DM senders are handed
  a time-limited pairing code; the owner approves or denies via `/pairing`.
- **Streaming and deduplication** — the outbound dispatcher coalesces stream
  deltas, gates progress and reasoning messages per channel capability, and
  retries on transient delivery failures, all in one place.

## 2. Mental model

**Decoupled bidirectional broker.** Two `asyncio.Queue` objects in
`MessageBus` are the only coupling between channels and the agent loop. Each
channel adapter runs its own async listener loop and pushes `InboundMessage`
objects onto `bus.inbound`; the agent loop consumes them and pushes
`OutboundMessage` objects onto `bus.outbound`. The outbound dispatcher
(`ChannelManager._dispatch_outbound`) consumes from `bus.outbound` and calls
the appropriate channel's `send` / `send_delta` methods. Neither side blocks
the other; the queues absorb timing differences.

**Plugin discovery with built-in priority.** `discover_all()` in
`durin/channels/registry.py` first scans the `durin.channels` package with
`pkgutil` to find built-in adapters, then loads external adapters registered
via the Python `entry_points` group `durin.channels`. Built-in adapters always
win if a plugin registers the same name. `ChannelManager._init_channels`
iterates the discovered classes, checks `config.channels.<name>.enabled`, and
instantiates the ones that are on.

**Inbound authorization and pairing.** Authorization is enforced once,
centrally, at the message-bus ingress via `MessageBus.publish_inbound`. When
`ChannelManager` starts it installs `_authorize_inbound` on the bus via
`bus.set_inbound_authorizer`. Every call to `publish_inbound` — from any
channel or internal publisher — runs through this gate before the message is
enqueued. Channels are pure transport and MUST NOT re-implement authorization
in their handlers.

The gate applies three rules in order: (1) messages whose channel name is not
in `ChannelManager.channels` (cli, cron, subagent, TUI — internal origins) are
always trusted; (2) for registered chat channels, `channel.is_allowed(sender_id)`
is called — star wildcard, allowlist, or pairing-store approval; (3) if denied
and the message is a DM (`is_dm=True`), a pairing code is generated via
`generate_code` and sent back to the sender; if denied and the message is a
group message, it is silently dropped.

`BaseChannel.is_allowed(sender_id)` checks three layers: a wildcard (`"*"`) in
`allow_from`, an exact match in the `allow_from` list, and a lookup in the
pairing store (`is_approved(channel, sender_id)`). Channels set `is_dm` on the
`InboundMessage` they publish so the gate can distinguish private from group
context. The pairing store is a small JSON file at `<durin_home>/pairing.json`
guarded by a `threading.Lock` plus `cross_process_lock` for cross-process
safety (see `durin/pairing/store.py`). The owner runs `/pairing approve <code>`
to move a sender from pending to approved.

## 4. How it works

### Startup

`MessageBus()` is constructed once per gateway process. `ChannelManager` is
constructed with the bus and the full `Config`. In `_init_channels` it calls
`discover_all()`, which combines built-in adapters found by
`pkgutil.iter_modules` with external adapters from `entry_points`. For each
enabled channel it resolves `${secret:}` credential references with
`_resolve_section_secrets` (so plaintext never lives in the shared config
object), constructs the channel, injects the shared `TranscriptionService`
(built once from `config.transcription`), and copies the global boolean
overrides (`send_progress`, `send_tool_hints`, `show_reasoning`). Per-channel
values in config can override the global defaults.

Once `start_all` is called, a dedicated asyncio task is created for
`_dispatch_outbound`, and one task per channel runs under a supervision loop
(`ChannelManager._start_channel`) that calls `channel.start()`.

**Channel crash supervision.** An exception raised out of `channel.start()` is
treated as a transient crash: the supervisor restarts the channel with a
capped exponential backoff, and the backoff resets once the channel has run
stably for a while. A clean return from `channel.start()`, by contrast, ends
supervision for that channel — it signals either a deliberate stop or a fatal
configuration error that a restart loop cannot fix and would only hammer the
platform with reconnect attempts. Fatal-configuration examples include a
rejected bot token, missing privileged intents, or another local process
already holding durin's per-token advisory lock — an advisory file lock that
prevents two gateways from double-replying on the same bot token; the second
starter refuses cleanly rather than raising.

**Liveness.** Discord also runs a REST-based liveness probe alongside the
gateway connection; when the probe detects a zombie socket the heartbeat
cannot see, it force-closes the connection so the crash supervisor above
reconnects it.

### Inbound path

Every channel's `start()` implementation runs a platform-specific event loop
(polling, webhook, or persistent connection). When an event arrives, the
channel calls `self._handle_message(sender_id, chat_id, content, is_dm=…)`.

`_handle_message` is purely a transport helper: it attaches the
`"_wants_stream": True` flag when the channel supports streaming
(`config.streaming=True` AND the subclass overrides `send_delta`), constructs
an `InboundMessage`, and calls `bus.publish_inbound`. Authorization is not
performed in the channel.

`MessageBus.publish_inbound` runs the installed inbound-authorizer gate before
enqueuing the message. `ChannelManager` installs `_authorize_inbound` as the
gate at construction time. `publish_inbound` is the only path that enqueues to
`bus.inbound`, so any message that reaches the bus is gated and the gate cannot
be bypassed once a message is published.

The channel contract is to be **pure transport**: publish unconditionally with
`is_dm` set and let the gate authorize — a channel should NOT re-implement
`is_allowed`/pairing in its handlers. **Telegram, Slack, and Discord are the
reference implementations of this contract.** Several other channels still
pre-filter with their own `is_allowed` check and early-`return` in their
handlers (legacy behaviour, unchanged here — those messages never reach the
gate); migrating them to pure transport so they route through the central
gate is a follow-up. New channels should follow the Telegram/Slack/Discord
model.

Pure transport applies to *sender authorization* only — the gate owns who is
allowed to talk to the bot. Channel-policy filters that decide *which
messages within an already-authorized conversation* get a response, such as
mention gating in group chats or an allowed-channels list, are unrelated to
authorization and stay channel-local. On top of the shared contract, Discord's
adapter applies two inbound normalizations of its own: it deduplicates
messages replayed by the gateway on reconnect, and it reassembles a long
message the Discord client split client-side before re-publishing it as one
`InboundMessage`.

The agent loop (`AgentLoop.run()`) consumes from `bus.inbound`. The
`InboundMessage.session_key` property returns `session_key_override` when set,
or `"{channel}:{chat_id}"` otherwise. This lets thread-scoped sessions (for
example, Slack threads) share a distinct session from the channel-level one.

### Outbound path

After completing a turn, the agent loop publishes one or more `OutboundMessage`
objects to `bus.outbound`. The `_dispatch_outbound` loop in `ChannelManager`
consumes these and applies a layered gating and transformation pipeline:

1. **Reasoning routing** — messages with `_reasoning_delta`, `_reasoning_end`,
   or `_reasoning` in metadata are routed only when `channel.show_reasoning`
   is true, and only channels that override `send_reasoning_delta` /
   `send_reasoning_end` render them (the default is a no-op).

2. **Progress gating** — `_progress` messages are passed through only when
   `channel.send_progress` is true. `_progress` messages with `_tool_hint=True`
   also check `send_tool_hints` (unless the channel renders structured tool
   payloads natively, in which case the gate is bypassed).

3. **Retry-wait gating** — `_retry_wait` messages are only delivered on the
   `websocket` channel (the webui shows a visible indicator; CLI/TUI users rely
   on the running indicator).

4. **Stream delta coalescing** — consecutive `_stream_delta` messages for the
   same `(channel, chat_id, _stream_id)` are merged into a single call via
   `_coalesce_stream_deltas`. This reduces API calls when the LLM generates
   faster than the platform can process. Coalescing stops at a stream-end
   marker or at the first message belonging to a different stream or target.

5. **Duplicate suppression** — for non-streaming final responses, the dispatcher
   computes a whitespace-normalized SHA1 fingerprint of the content and checks
   it against `_origin_reply_fingerprints` keyed by `(channel, chat_id,
   origin_message_id)`. Identical content for the same origin message is
   suppressed. Progress and streaming messages are exempt from this check.

6. **Delivery** — `_send_with_retry` dispatches to `_send_once`, which calls
   the appropriate channel method (`send_reasoning_end`, `send_reasoning_delta`,
   `send_delta`, or `send`). On failure it retries up to
   `config.channels.send_max_retries` times with exponential backoff delays of
   1s, 2s, and 4s.

### Channel adapter contract

Every channel is a subclass of `BaseChannel` with three abstract methods:

- `start()` — long-running async listener; pushes inbound messages to the bus
  via `_handle_message` (which calls `bus.publish_inbound`). Channels publish
  unconditionally and set `is_dm=True` when the message arrived in a private
  chat so the central gate can distinguish DM from group context.
- `stop()` — graceful shutdown.
- `send(msg: OutboundMessage)` — deliver a final response; raise on failure so
  the manager retries.

Adapters may transform content before delivery. Discord's `send` converts GFM
tables to bullet lists before chunking, since Discord's client does not render
markdown tables, and posts to forum and media channels as a new thread instead
of a plain message, since those channel types reject plain sends.

Two optional streaming methods default to no-ops: `send_delta(chat_id, delta,
metadata)` and `send_reasoning_delta(chat_id, delta, metadata)`. The
`supports_streaming` property returns `True` only when both `config.streaming`
is true and the subclass actually overrides `send_delta` (checked by identity
against `BaseChannel.send_delta`).

`is_allowed(sender_id)` is a policy method called by the central gate — NOT by
the channel itself. It checks: `"*"` in `allow_from`, exact match in
`allow_from`, and `is_approved(channel, sender_id)` from the pairing store.
Channels MUST NOT call `is_allowed` in their own handlers.

A channel registers its default configuration via the class method
`default_config()` which the onboarding flow uses to seed `config.json`.

### Audio transcription contract

When a channel transcribes incoming audio at the channel level, it must pass the
transcript text to the agent and **drop the audio path from `media`**. The raw
path is forwarded only when transcription fails, as a fallback for the
`interpret_audio` tool. This mirrors the TUI drag-drop path
(`durin/cli/dragdrop.py::transcribe_dragged_audio`) and the WhatsApp adapter
(`durin/channels/whatsapp.py`), and matches the agent loop's `audio_mode="auto"`
behaviour, which silently skips audio paths in `media`. Passing both the
transcript text and the raw path causes the model to invent a file path and call
`interpret_audio` on it — a hallucination the contract prevents.

The transcript is handed over as the **bare user message**, not wrapped in a
`[transcription: …]` marker. A marker reads to the model as a transcript of a
separate audio file it should open, so it narrates that it cannot access the
audio; the bare text reads as what the user said.

WhatsApp is the reference implementation of this contract. Channels that
transcribe locally (currently Telegram, Discord, Matrix, Feishu, and Weixin)
apply the same idiom: on transcription success, return an empty `media` list
and the transcript as the bare user message text; on failure, return the audio
path so the `interpret_audio` tool remains a usable fallback.

### Pairing store

The pairing store (`durin/pairing/store.py`) is a small JSON file at
`<durin_home>/pairing.json` with two top-level sections: `"approved"` (channel
→ set of sender IDs) and `"pending"` (code → `{channel, sender_id,
expires_at}`). All mutations use `threading.Lock` plus `cross_process_lock`
over the file path for cross-process safety. Expired pending entries are
collected lazily by `_gc_pending` on every read-modify-write; there is no
background worker. `approve_code` moves an entry from pending to approved;
`deny_code` removes it; `revoke` removes an approved sender.

## 5. Key types and entry points

| Symbol | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseChannel` | `durin/channels/base.py` | Abstract adapter base. Owns `_handle_message` (publishes to bus; no auth), `is_allowed` (policy called by the gate, not the channel), `supports_streaming`, `send`, `send_delta`, `send_reasoning_delta`, `send_reasoning_end`, `transcribe_audio`. |
| `ChannelManager` | `durin/channels/manager.py` | Lifecycle and dispatch coordinator. `_init_channels` discovers and instantiates. `_dispatch_outbound` applies gating, coalescing, dedup, and retry. `start_all` / `stop_all` manage the asyncio task tree. |
| `MessageBus` | `durin/bus/queue.py` | Two `asyncio.Queue` objects (`inbound`, `outbound`). `publish_inbound` runs the installed inbound-authorizer gate before enqueuing; `set_inbound_authorizer` wires the gate. |
| `InboundMessage` | `durin/bus/events.py` | Channel-to-loop event: `channel`, `sender_id`, `chat_id`, `content`, `media`, `metadata`, `session_key_override`. `session_key` property returns override or `"channel:chat_id"`. |
| `OutboundMessage` | `durin/bus/events.py` | Loop-to-channel event: `channel`, `chat_id`, `content`, `reply_to`, `media`, `metadata`, `buttons`. Metadata carries routing and flag keys such as `_progress`, `_stream_delta`, `_reasoning_delta`, `_retry_wait`. |
| `discover_all` | `durin/channels/registry.py` | Returns merged dict of built-in (pkgutil scan) + external (entry_points) channel classes. Built-ins shadow plugins of the same name. |
| `generate_code` | `durin/pairing/store.py` | Creates a pairing code (`ABCD-EFGH` format, 8 chars) for an unapproved DM sender and writes it to `pairing.json` with a TTL. |
| `approve_code` | `durin/pairing/store.py` | Moves a pending code to the approved set; returns `(channel, sender_id)` or `None` if expired or absent. |
| `is_approved` | `durin/pairing/store.py` | Read-only check: is `sender_id` in the approved set for `channel`? |
| `handle_pairing_command` | `durin/pairing/store.py` | Pure function dispatching `/pairing list|approve|deny|revoke` subcommands. Used by both CLI and `CommandRouter`. |
| `format_pairing_reply` | `durin/pairing/store.py` | Returns the user-facing string sent to an unapproved DM sender containing their pairing code. |
| `TelegramChannel` | `durin/channels/telegram.py` | Telegram adapter using `python-telegram-bot`. Implements streaming via in-place message edits. |
| `SlackChannel` | `durin/channels/slack.py` | Slack Socket Mode adapter. Implements streaming via in-place `chat.update` edits, thread-scoped sessions, quoted/forwarded-content extraction, and mentioned-thread auto-follow. |
| `WebSocketChannel` | `durin/channels/websocket.py` | WebSocket server channel that also hosts the embedded webui SPA. Handles token issuance, `websocket_requires_token`, and session/cron integration. |
| `EmailChannel` | `durin/channels/email.py` | IMAP+SMTP adapter. Polls for new messages and sends replies. |

## 6. Configuration and surfaces

### Global channel settings (`channels.*`)

| Config key | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `channels.send_progress` | bool | `true` | Deliver intermediate progress messages to channels. Per-channel override allowed. |
| `channels.send_tool_hints` | bool | `false` | Deliver tool-call hint messages (e.g. `read_file("…")`). Per-channel override allowed. |
| `channels.show_reasoning` | bool | `true` | Route model reasoning content to channels that implement the reasoning primitives. Per-channel override allowed. |
| `channels.send_max_retries` | int | `3` | Total delivery attempts (includes initial send). Range 0–10. |
| `channels.transcription_provider` | str | `"groq"` | Voice transcription backend (`"groq"` or `"openai"`). Overridden by the `transcription.*` section for local/HTTP modes. |
| `channels.transcription_language` | str or null | `null` | ISO-639-1 language hint for audio transcription (e.g. `"en"`). |

### Per-channel settings

Each channel section is stored as an extra field on `ChannelsConfig`. Common
keys accepted by most adapters:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `enabled` | Boolean gate; channel is only instantiated when `true`. |
| `allow_from` | List of allowed sender IDs, or `["*"]` for open access. Also accepted as `allowFrom`. |
| `streaming` | Enable streaming output (requires that the channel implements `send_delta`). |
| `token` | API token or bot secret for the channel backend. Supports `${secret:<name>}` references. |

Channel-specific extensions:

- **Telegram**: no additional permission fields beyond `allow_from`.
- **Discord**: `allow_channels` — list of Discord channel IDs allowed to
  trigger the bot (empty means all; a thread also matches its parent channel,
  so allowing a forum covers its posts). `group_policy` (`mention`/`open`),
  the read-receipt and working emojis with their delay, and `proxy*`. Sender
  authorization uses the standard `allow_from` + pairing flow via the central
  ingress gate. Gateway intents are **not configurable**: they are derived from
  the events the adapter handles — guilds, guild messages, direct messages and
  message content — because durin implements no member, presence, voice or
  reaction-event handler. A legacy `intents` key is ignored with a warning
  rather than silently dropped.
- **Slack**: `dm_enabled` (routing toggle for DMs), `group_policy`
  (`open`/`mention`/`allowlist`), `group_allow_from` (channel IDs for the
  allowlist policy), `open_channels` (rooms that reply to every message under
  any policy), and `thread_auto_follow` (answer follow-ups in a mentioned
  thread without re-mention). Sender authorization uses the standard
  `allow_from` + pairing flow via the central ingress gate.
- **Persona per channel** (any adapter): a `persona` key on the channel
  section sets the default persona for sessions born there; a
  `chat_personas` map (chat id → persona name) refines it per conversation.
  Resolution lives in `durin.personas.resolve` with precedence: cron
  override > session pick > chat map > channel default > global default.
- **Email**: `imap_host`, `imap_port`, `imap_username`, `imap_password`,
  `imap_mailbox`, `imap_use_ssl`, `smtp_host`, `smtp_port`, `smtp_username`,
  `smtp_password`, `smtp_use_tls`, `smtp_use_ssl`, `auto_reply_enabled`.
- **WebSocket** (webui): `host`, `port`, `path`, `token`,
  `token_issue_secret`, `websocket_requires_token` (bool; default `true`),
  `allow_from` (default `["*"]`).

### Plugin channel registration

External channels are registered via the Python `entry_points` group
`durin.channels`. The entry point name becomes the channel's config key. A
plugin that declares:

```toml
[project.entry-points."durin.channels"]
mychannel = "mypkg.channels.mychannel:MyChannel"
```

will be discovered at startup and can be enabled with
`channels.mychannel.enabled = true` in `config.json`.

### CLI / TUI / webui surfaces

- **`/pairing list`** — show pending pairing requests with TTL remaining.
- **`/pairing approve <code>`** — approve an unapproved sender.
- **`/pairing deny <code>`** — reject and discard a pairing code.
- **`/pairing revoke <user_id>`** — remove an approved sender from the current
  channel; `revoke <channel> <user_id>` targets a specific channel.
- **Webui** — the WebSocket channel hosts the embedded single-page app at the
  configured `host:port/path`. Authentication is handled via `token` or
  `token_issue_secret` (reverse-proxy path).

### Dashboard channel services

A channel renders a typed, grouped settings form when its class overrides
`config_model()`; a field reaches that form only if it carries a `group` in
`json_schema_extra` or is marked `secret`. Channels that expose no fields fall
back to a single credential box.

Telegram, Slack and Discord additionally have a service module
(`durin/service/channels_<name>.py`) backing a guided panel. Each registers in
**both** `durin/service/catalog.py` and `durin/service/wiring.py` — a service
present in only one is served to tooling and silently 405s on the live gateway,
and a test freezes that invariant. All three expose a token `test` plus the
pairing quartet (list / approve / deny / revoke) over the channel-agnostic
pairing store. Slack adds workspace-channel listing and joining; Discord adds
guild-and-channel listing and a least-privilege OAuth invite URL. The Discord
service is REST-only against the configured token, so its panel keeps working
while the channel is stopped, and its `test` reports whether the bot may read
message content as `enabled | limited | disabled | unknown` — `limited` is the
normal state of an unverified app, which works until it passes 100 guilds.

Adding or changing a route means regenerating the contract
(`PYTHONPATH=<worktree> python scripts/gen_openapi.py`, then
`cd webui && bun run gen:api-types`); running the generator without
`PYTHONPATH` from a worktree imports the installed package and silently emits a
stale contract.

### Viewing non-websocket sessions in the webui

The webui sidebar lists sessions from all channels (Telegram, CLI, subagent,
etc.). Historically, clicking one returned a 404 because the rich per-session
JSONL transcript used by the thread endpoint is written only by the websocket
channel (`append_transcript_object` in `durin/channels/websocket.py`).

The thread endpoint (`GET /api/v1/sessions/{key}/webui-thread`) now falls back
to the **universal session history** when no JSONL exists: it reads the
OpenAI-format messages via `SessionManager.read_session_file` and converts them
to the webui `UIMessage` shape with `session_messages_to_ui_messages`
(`durin/utils/webui_transcript.py`). The payload carries `"readOnly": true` so
the frontend knows the session cannot be continued from the webui (the webui
would spawn a new websocket session, not resume the original channel). The
`ThreadShell` component disables the composer and shows a banner when the active
session's `channel` is not `"websocket"`.

The converter is a pure function (no I/O): media signing reuses the channel's
existing `_augment_transcript_user_media` callback, which HMAC-signs file paths
using the same per-process `_media_secret` as websocket sessions.

## 7. Curated rationale

**Why two queues instead of direct calls?** The agent loop processes one turn
at a time per session (holding a per-session asyncio lock). Direct calls from a
channel to the loop would either block the channel's listener or require the
loop to expose a thread-safe API. The queue pair inverts the dependency: both
sides push and pull at their own pace, and neither knows the other's
implementation. This also makes it straightforward to add new channels without
touching the loop code.

**Why do built-in channels shadow external plugins?** This prevents a
third-party package from accidentally (or maliciously) overriding a built-in
adapter by registering the same name. Operators who want to replace a built-in
adapter must fork the package, not just install a plugin.

**Why is duplicate suppression keyed to `origin_message_id`?** The same
response can be published more than once if a session has multiple active
consumers (for example, the agent pushes an `OutboundMessage` and a background
task also triggers a response for the same original message). Fingerprinting by
`(channel, chat_id, origin_message_id)` limits suppression to the scope of a
single inbound message and avoids silently dropping a legitimately different
response sent later in the same chat.

**Why is pairing a JSON file rather than a database table?** The pairing store
is designed for private-assistant scale: a handful of channels and a small
number of users. A JSON file under `cross_process_lock` is sufficient, requires
no migration, and survives gateway restarts without a daemon. Operators who need
LDAP or SSO-style access control implement a custom channel adapter with a
custom `is_allowed` policy; the central gate calls it uniformly.

**Why is authorization enforced at the bus rather than in each channel?**
Putting the gate at `MessageBus.publish_inbound` gives a single enforcement
point that runs for every message a channel publishes — a pure-transport channel
cannot publish an unauthorized message past it, even if it gets its own DM
detection wrong, and the pairing logic lives in one place instead of being
re-implemented per channel. (A channel that still pre-filters with its own
`is_allowed` and early-returns short-circuits before publishing, so it never
reaches the gate; that is the legacy pattern the pure-transport migration
removes — Telegram first, then Slack and Discord.)

**Why does stream coalescing key on `_stream_id` and not just `(channel,
chat_id)`?** Channels like Telegram forum topics or Discord threads can have
multiple independent streams open on the same `chat_id` simultaneously. Without
the `_stream_id` guard, deltas from stream B would be merged into the batch for
stream A, corrupting both messages.
